# Folder and Note Creation Debugging Guide

## Summary of Changes

I've investigated and fixed the reported issues with folder and note creation not working. Here's what was done:

### 1. Fixed API Import Issues

**Problem**: The `folders.mutations.ts` file was importing from the old mock API instead of the new IndexedDB API.

**Fix**: Updated [src/lib/api/mutations/folders.mutations.ts](src/lib/api/mutations/folders.mutations.ts) to:
- Import from `client/folders.api.ts` instead of `folders.api.ts`
- Use `DBFolder` type instead of `Folder`
- Match function signatures with IndexedDB API

### 2. Added Comprehensive Logging

Added detailed console logging throughout the entire folder/note creation flow:

- **[IndexedDB] level**: Core database operations in `src/lib/db/folders.ts` and `src/lib/db/notes.ts`
- **[FoldersAPI] level**: API abstraction layer in `src/lib/api/client/folders.api.ts`
- **[NotesAPI] level**: API abstraction layer in `src/lib/api/client/notes.api.ts`
- **[DEBUG] level**: UI layer in `dashboard-sidebar.tsx` and `use-dashboard.ts`

### 3. Created Test Page

Created a dedicated test page at [/test-db](http://localhost:3000/test-db) that:
- Tests IndexedDB initialization
- Tests folder creation (root and nested)
- Tests note creation (root and in folders)
- Displays results in real-time
- Shows environment configuration
- Provides detailed error messages

## How to Test

### Option 1: Use the Test Page (Recommended)

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/test-db

3. Open browser Developer Console (F12)

4. Click "Run Tests" button

5. Check both:
   - The test results on the page
   - Console logs for detailed flow tracking

### Option 2: Test Manually in Dashboard

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard

3. Open browser Developer Console (F12)

4. Try creating a folder:
   - Click "Create New" → "New Folder"
   - Enter a name and select location
   - Click "Create Folder"
   - Watch console for logs:
     ```
     [DEBUG] Creating folder: ...
     [FoldersAPI] createFolder called: ...
     [IndexedDB] createFolder called: ...
     [IndexedDB] Folder added successfully: ...
     ```

5. Try creating a note:
   - Click "Create New" → "New Note"
   - Enter title and select folder
   - Click "노트 생성"
   - Watch console for logs:
     ```
     [DEBUG] Creating note: ...
     [NotesAPI] createNote called: ...
     [IndexedDB] createNote called: ...
     [IndexedDB] Note added successfully: ...
     ```

## What to Look For

### If Creation Succeeds

You'll see console logs like:
```
[DEBUG] Creating folder: Test Folder in parent: null
[FoldersAPI] createFolder called: {name: "Test Folder", parentId: null, USE_LOCAL: true}
[FoldersAPI] Using IndexedDB for folder creation
[IndexedDB] createFolder called: {name: "Test Folder", parentId: null}
[IndexedDB] DB initialized for folder creation
[IndexedDB] Folder object created: {id: "...", name: "Test Folder", ...}
[IndexedDB] Folder added successfully: ...
[FoldersAPI] Folder created in IndexedDB: {...}
[DEBUG] Folder created successfully
```

### If Creation Fails

The logs will show exactly where it failed:
- If it stops after `[FoldersAPI] createFolder called`, the issue is in the API layer
- If it stops after `[IndexedDB] DB initialized`, the issue is with the database transaction
- If you see `[IndexedDB] Folder creation failed`, check the error message that follows

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "IndexedDB is not defined"

**Symptom**: Error about indexedDB not being defined

**Solution**: This only happens in tests. IndexedDB is browser-only. Testing must be done in a real browser, not in Node.js tests.

### 2. "Creating..." Button Stuck

**Symptom**: Button shows "Creating..." forever

**Possible Causes**:
- Promise never resolves/rejects
- Error thrown but not caught
- Modal closing before state updates

**Debug**: Check console logs to see where execution stops

### 3. No Errors but Nothing Created

**Symptom**: No console errors but folder/note doesn't appear

**Possible Causes**:
- Cache not invalidated
- Component not re-rendering
- Data saved but not displayed

**Debug**:
1. Check if item exists in IndexedDB (Application tab in DevTools)
2. Refresh the page
3. Check console logs for successful creation

## Environment Configuration

Verify your `.env.local` has:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LOCAL_DB=true
```

This ensures IndexedDB is used instead of backend API.

## Build Status

✅ Build completed successfully with no errors

Warnings (expected):
- Console statement warnings (debug logging)
- React hooks exhaustive-deps warnings
- Next.js Image optimization suggestions

## Files Modified

1. [src/lib/api/mutations/folders.mutations.ts](src/lib/api/mutations/folders.mutations.ts) - Fixed imports and types
2. [src/lib/db/folders.ts](src/lib/db/folders.ts) - Added logging
3. [src/lib/db/notes.ts](src/lib/db/notes.ts) - Added logging
4. [src/lib/api/client/folders.api.ts](src/lib/api/client/folders.api.ts) - Added logging
5. [src/lib/api/client/notes.api.ts](src/lib/api/client/notes.api.ts) - Added logging
6. [src/app/(user)/test-db/page.tsx](src/app/(user)/test-db/page.tsx) - New test page

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Browser**: Run the test page or manually test creation
2. **Check Console**: Look for the detailed logs to identify issues
3. **Report Back**: If issues persist, provide:
   - Console logs from the point of failure
   - Browser and version
   - Exact steps to reproduce
   - Any error messages

## Expected Behavior

**Folder Creation**:
1. Click "Create New" → "New Folder"
2. Modal opens with folder name input and tree selector
3. Enter name and select parent (or leave as Root)
4. Click "Create Folder"
5. Modal closes
6. New folder appears in sidebar immediately

**Note Creation**:
1. Click "Create New" → "New Note"
2. Modal opens with title input and folder selector
3. Enter title and optionally upload files
4. Select destination folder
5. Click "노트 생성"
6. Modal closes
7. Redirects to new note page
8. Note appears in recent section
